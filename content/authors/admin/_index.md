🎓 I’m a master student at Ningxia University.

🔍 My research is mainly based on the Yellow River Basin in China, and adopts the theory of system science to reveal the multi-process coupling mechanism and stress effect of water-sediment, ecology-economy in the Yellow River basin system, and determine the core elements and critical thresholds of the steady-state transformation of water-sediment, ecology-economy system in different regions and different development stages.
